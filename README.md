## Week 3 : Air Quality Index Week 03 Final Project - Data Modeling
This repository provides an implementation of an Air Quality Index (AQI) system that allows users to monitor air pollution levels in various locations. The project utilizes real-time data from air quality monitoring APIs to assess the quality of the air based on several key pollutants, including PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, O3, and CO.
